Twitter Chat Bot 

# Setup

####Get set up with Twitter To begin, you'll need to register your application with Twitter and get the proper keys. Log into or sign up for a Twitter account, and scroll down to "Manage Your Apps." Click "Create a New App" and fill out the form with the app's details. Once you're on the app's management page, select the "Permissions" tab. Make sure access is set to "Read and Write." Finally, navigate to the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab. Note your "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Key Secret" tokens, and initialize the app's Access Tokens ("Access Token" and "Access Token Secret"). Keep these four keys for later.
